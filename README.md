# Chaotic
# What?
Just a badly written page to easily enable AUR (and more?) on my mechine running immutable astOS.
the code to which is here: https://github.com/astos/astos

# Where?
It's just a partial implementation of this guide:
https://aur.chaotic.cx/ and some other stuff... 
you can build your own easily.

# Why?
because it's annoying and time-consuming for me to check if a package is in the aur or not every time. I'm trying to reinstall my weaboo wallpaper changer.
now every install is done with: "ast install 1 <package name>" like a friggin' human-being.

It also notably eliminates a bug currently featured involving MAKEPKG that I couldn't bring myself to bother with!
I'm a busy man, I have nerdy places to be.

# How?
by adding a line to the python script before installation
(which, by the way, is NOT reccommended!)
you can find the line yourself, it is located somwhere in the astos Main.py file.
I do not know python yet, but the line is obvoius.
I do not condone any of this by the way... like mentioned before,
this page is for my extremely specific (possibly bats*it)
case... the ONLY reason it's public is because I don't know ssh either.

I made a mental note not to use sudo
anywhere in this script - the entire point
of this practice is to run it in root.

# is it OK If I use it?
only if you are aware of the risks and are either:
```sh
1. from the far future, where archlinux is immutable out of the box
2. if, like me, you are using the astOS script (good for you)
```
then it might be worth a try.
though don't come crying when your system breaks for some reason!
this script/website is not meant for you to use,
(but I absolutely reccommend that you build your own.)

# !!!WARNING!!!
```sh
READ. THE. SCRIPT.
do not just run it!!!

If you balme me for any damage to your system after using this script,
I will laugh at you.

anything LEGAL you do on your mechine is your business and by
denying it your'e supporting the big brother.
I'm not your daddy, and being reckless on the internet was never on the table.

so stfu (a kind of tofu. don't google it.), grab a drink and start reading the script.
```
# !!!END OF WARNING!!!

!!!HAVE A NICE DAY!!!

!!!YOU DESERVE IT!!!

!!!XOXO!!!
