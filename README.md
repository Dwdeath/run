# Chaotic
# What?
Just a badly written page to easily enable AUR (and more?) on my mechine running immutable astOS

# Where?
It's just a partial implementation of this guide:
https://aur.chaotic.cx/
you can build your own easily.

# Why?
because it's annoying and time-consuming to go: "ast chroot 1, yay -S <package name>" every
time I'm trying to reinstall my weaboo wallpaper changer.
now I can simply go: "ast install 1 <package name>" like a friggin' human-being.

# is it OK If I use it?
only if you are aware of the risks and are either:
''
1. from the far future, where archlinux is immutable out of the box
2. if, like me, your'e using the astOS script (good for you)
''
then it might be worth a try.
though don't come crying when your system breaks for some reason!
this script/website isn't meant for you to use,
(but I absolutely reccommend that you build your own.)

# !!!WARNING!!!
READ. THE. SCRIPT.
do not just run it!!!

If you balme me for any damage to your system after using this script,
I will laugh at you.

anything LEGAL you do on your mechine is your business and by
denying it your'e supporting the big brother.
I'm not your daddy, and being reckless on the internet was never on the table.

so stfu (a kind of tofu. don't google it.), grab a drink and start reading the script.
# !!!END OF WARNING!!!

!!!HAVE A NICE DAY!!!
!!!YOU DESERVE IT!!!

!!!XOXO!!!
